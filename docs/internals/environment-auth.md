# Environment authentication

The environment issues its own sessions and enforces their capabilities. Cloud
identity and relay credentials belong to a separate trust boundary, described in
[T3 Connect](./t3-connect.md). A relay token is never an environment login.

## Authority survives transport changes

Pairing delegates a set of scopes. Exchanging a bootstrap credential can narrow
that grant but cannot widen it. Ordinary pairing does not grant access-management
or relay-management authority. Creating another pairing link requires both
`access:write` and every scope being delegated. The
[auth handlers](../../apps/server/src/auth/http.ts) enforce this at issuance;
client labels and device metadata have no authorization role.

The access read model contains pairing metadata, never recoverable pairing
secrets. Only the creation response returns the raw credential. Otherwise read
access to the connections list would become a way to acquire another client's
authority.

Browser cookies, bearer tokens, and DPoP tokens adapt the same scoped session
model. DPoP binds a token to a client's proof key; an invalid proof must fail
rather than fall back to bearer authentication. The OAuth token-exchange
vocabulary gives these grants a familiar meaning, but the environment does not
implement a general-purpose OAuth authorization server.

Bearer and DPoP clients obtain short-lived WebSocket tickets through authenticated
HTTP so long-lived tokens stay out of socket URLs. Browser sessions can
authenticate the upgrade with their cookie. A successful handshake grants no
extra authority: [every RPC declares a required
scope](../../apps/server/src/auth/RpcAuthorization.ts).

Desktop restarts forget the previous local bearer token, so its reusable
bootstrap grant replaces earlier sessions for the same subject and method.
Revocation and insertion share a [database
transaction](../../apps/server/src/persistence/AuthSessions.ts); a failed
replacement must leave the old credential usable. Pairing and browser sessions
do not follow this replacement rule.

### Reusable dev credential

Web development environments can accept one `T3CODE_DEV_AUTH_TOKEN` across
worktrees and ports on one hostname. The token and startup URLs that contain it
grant administrative access. Desktop and non-development servers ignore it. See
the [development runbook](../operations/development.md#reusable-dev-credential)
for setup.

Each environment hashes the value and seeds its own database record at startup.
Environments do not share SQLite data, signing keys, environment IDs, session
records, pairing grants, or revocation state. Local revocation persists after
restart and does not affect another worktree. Removing or rotating the value
and restarting invalidates the old credential and its WebSocket tickets.

Normal credentials keep precedence. A rejected normal credential never falls
back to the reusable credential. OAuth exchanges create ordinary local bearer
or DPoP children with normal expiry and revocation. The reusable cookie expires
after 30 days.

## The environment is the filesystem boundary

Projects are organizational boundaries, not filesystem sandboxes.
`orchestration:read` permits reading files the server account can read, including
absolute paths outside a project. This lets clients display artifacts that an
agent writes in a temporary directory. Relative paths and writes still follow
the [workspace path rules](../../apps/server/src/workspace/WorkspaceFileSystem.ts).
For team members who are not admins, [WorkspaceAccess](../../apps/server/src/team/WorkspaceAccess.ts)
narrows this to their projects' checkouts, so such artifacts do not display
for them.

## Team members act as themselves on every path

A session's subject decides which team member it acts as; scopes decide what
kind of call it may make. Pairing preserves the subject through browser
cookies, token exchange, and WebSocket tickets, so a member credential behaves
the same over LAN, Tailscale, the hosted app, and a T3 Connect tunnel. The T3
Connect relay itself only mints credentials for the linked cloud user, the
environment owner; teammates pair against the tunnel address instead.

Every orchestration command carries an actor that the server derives, never
one the caller supplies, and passes
[ThreadAccess](../../apps/server/src/team/ThreadAccess.ts) before dispatch.
Client commands act as the session's member. MCP tools act as the owner of the
thread their credential was issued for, read from the read model rather than
from tool input, so an agent cannot reach another member's thread through a
tool argument. The project CLI acts as the environment owner. Dispatch the
server starts on its own, such as from reactors, carries no actor.

RPCs that name a working directory, thread, or project instead of sending a
command (files, VCS, review, previews, pull requests) go through
WorkspaceAccess, which resolves a path to the deepest thread worktree or
project root containing it. New RPCs of that shape need the same gate; the
scope table alone does not separate teammates. None of this is a sandbox:
members' agents run as the server account.

Signed asset URLs are bearer credentials. A URL for media on the host grants
access to one canonical file and its device/inode identity, not its containing directory.
[Asset access](../../apps/server/src/assets/AssetAccess.ts) rechecks the opened
file's identity when serving it, so atomic replacement requires a new URL while
editing the same file in place does not. An HTML file authorized this way cannot
load sibling assets; directory-scoped workspace previews are a separate grant.
Clients should share the authored file reference so they do not disclose the
temporary URL's credential.

Host videos can change in place. Their [HTTP
responses](../../apps/server/src/http.ts) omit cache validators because file
metadata cannot prove byte-for-byte identity for `If-Range`. Adding weak
validators would turn native-player seeks into full downloads.
